You may recognise this white-grey, velvety wood from the model-making shops of your childhood. Because it is so light and easily cut with a craft knife, it is perfect for making model aircraft or for whittling. Because this wood has a lower density than cork it is put to use in other applications where its low density is useful – for example as the core in many surfboards, or in the blades of wind-turbines. In both these applications it is normally laminated with something like a glass-reinforced plastic as, although it is strong for its weight, it is still a very soft and fragile material. All of the balsa wood cores in the Materials Library collection show signs of wear and tear, and this particular sample shows the damage that can be caused by simply putting pressure on the wood with your fingers. The tree that produces this wood is the spectacularly fast-growing and short-lived Ochroma Pyramidale, which can grow to heights of 30 metres in 10 to 15 years, and generally doesn’t live beyond 30 to 40 years. These trees are largely found in the tropical forests of South America, with Ecuador being the largest commercial producer of balsa wood. The lightness of the wood can be explained by the fact that it is comprised of large, thin-walled cells. When the tree is alive, these cells are filled with water to give the tree the strength it needs to stand in the jungle. Before it is treated, balsa contains about five times as much water as lignin, but this water is driven off during an extended kiln-drying process so that the wood can be used.

This treacle-coloured, crystalline object was found by the Institute of Making’s Creative Director Zoe Laughlin at her family farm. Although completely warped and now totally dysfunctional as a result of UV degradation, it is still recognisably a roll of Sellotape. Sellotape is in fact the trademark of the British brand, but it has become the colloquial name for transparent, cellulose-based tape with an adhesive on one side. This generic trademark has even made it into the Oxford English Dictionary.

This composite material is a sandwich of polyester resin, glass fibres and an aramid paper honeycomb. These three materials can be fairly weak in isolation, but combined in this particular structure they are exceptionally strong for their weight. So strong in fact that these kind of reinforced honeycomb sandwich panels have been used in the floor and wing panels of Boeing 747s. The geometry of the honeycomb, which occurs naturally in bones and beehives, gives it very good stiffness and resistance to compression. Because each of the tessellating hexagons is hollow, the honeycomb uses less material for the same function and has heat and sound insulating properties. Because the glass fibre and paper are immersed in a transparent resin, you can see the intermeshing materials, which create an interesting optical effect.

Chalk sticks, used as writing and drawing implements by maths teachers and artists alike, were traditionally made out of natural chalk - a soft and porous sedimentary rock composed of calcium carbonate deposits formed over about 90 million years from the compression of the decomposing skeletons of phytoplankton (tiny marine algae), on the ocean floor. Chalk has been used as a pigment in art since the Palaeolithic era, and became particularly popular in the 15th century amongst Early Renaissance artists. A lot of the children's coloured chalks, artists' pastels and 'pavement chalks' we use now are made from softer and less expensive calcareous materials like gypsum (calcium sulphate). However, anxieties over the potential health hazard of the blackboard dust generated by these cheaper materials led to the development of 'dustless' classroom chalks: these chalks primarily use calcium carbonate (natural chalk) as their raw material, and are extruded as a 'rope' of chalk. This process of extruding calcium carbonate makes the chalk particles heavier so they fall straight to the ground, rather than flying around as dust. Impurities in chalk deposits naturally produce chalks of different colours, but pigments - in this case a raw Sienna brown - are added to make colours more vivid. In order to make chalk sticks, the chalk or gypsum is pulverized to a fine powder, mixed with a binder (like clay), water and a pigment to form a putty, then formed into cylinders and baked.

When played, the spruce tuning fork produces no audible ring, but rather a singular note of no duration is produced, though there is a knack to getting a sound from it. You need to hold the base of the fork firmly in one hand and bringing it close to the ear before pinching the two prongs together and releasing them in a sort of pinching manner that causes the prongs to vibrate. When played in this fashion, the sound produced is surprisingly higher in pitch than the brass fork and is closer to that of the steel and gold forks. Spruce is a type of wood produced by the coniferous tree and is thus classified as a softwood. The fibres of the wood are long and its grain is compact, straight and parallel giving it a distinctive appearance. Wood is often used as an acoustic dampener, absorbing some frequencies whilst enabling the propagation of others in the manner of an acoustic filter. Spruce does this particularly well due to its parallel bands of hard and soft matter that constitute the grain of the material. This could account for the popularity of spruce as a material for making guitars and violins, thought its superior strength to weight ratio undoubted also plays a part.

The manufacturers of this biodegradable cutlery don’t say exactly how it is made, but it is likely that it has been injection moulded from a thermoplastic starch or cellulose base mixed with a polymer derived from either fossil fuels or biofuels. All plastics are biodegradable, given enough time. In order to be classified as compostable, plastics have to biodegrade within a strict and standardised time frame, but materials producers and waste managers are still struggling to define a time frame for biodegradability. As such, it means very little to simply state that a material is ‘biodegradable’ without specifying the precise conditions required for its biodegradation. The producer of this biodegradable fork state that their products are biodegradable through composting; some have to be domestically composted, and others will biodegrade in the soil. These sorts of technologies have been developed to try and deal with the very dispersed and visible problem of plastic waste in the sea and littered across the landscape. They are not always effective, since these biodegradable materials often end up in landfill, where biodegradation is largely anaerobic, and plastics that do break down in these conditions form methane gas. Ideally, these plastics would be fished out of the waste stream and composted at home. This is not made easy by the fact that the fork has no markings on it to show that it is biodegradable or compostable.

This solid ball is made from beech wood, and is just big enough to close your fingers around. Beech is a hardwood often light in colour. European Beech trees are commonly cultivated in Scandinavia, where these unpainted simple wooden shapes and toys are still popular as children’s toys. Wooden beech balls this size are sold as craft supplies, for making things like a doll’s head, or to soak in essential oils as a potpourri to scent your home. They are normally machine-carved on a lathe to achieve a regular sphere.

Companies have long since used packing materials to protect their merchandise during shipment. Early packaging materials included actual peanuts, newspaper and eventually the loose-fill packing peanuts made of expanded polystyrene foam, which is one of the most commonly used form today. Starch-based packing peanuts were first developed in the early 1990s. The starch in the peanuts comes from corn crop-based sources rather than petroleum-based polystyrene, and is non-toxic. Cornstarch packing peanuts are biodegradable and can be disposed of instantly by merely adding water. Rather than ordering large shipments of pre-made polystyrene peanuts, many shipping companies have begun to fitout their warehouses with extrusion machines to produce pellets on dmenad from much smaller resin pills. One 2,000 pound tote of the resin pellets produces about as many peanuts as a lorry load of expanded packing peanuts. One trailer load of the resin pellet material is equivalent to approximately 23 lorry loads of pre-made expanded packing peanuts. With the introduction of such environmentally friendly product and processes the related decrease in freight coupled with less handling, less warehousing, and readily available packaging material has the potential to drastically reduce the packaging and shipping industry’s carbon footprint.

It looks like the manufacturers of this soft coral-pink foam sphere have made a mould of a golf ball, and cast it in a self-skinning polyurethane foam – perhaps as part of a kid’s toy golf set. This material comes in two parts – a liquid and a catalyst, which, when mixed and poured into a mould, will expand up to six times its original size. As it cures, or ‘goes off’, a tough outer flexible skin forms, which picks up the detail in the mould and creates a visible seam line, which needs to be trimmed off. It can be used in open or closed moulds, as the skin starts forming as the material has finished expanding, not when it reaches a surface, or is exposed to air. It’s an example of an open cell, or reticulated foam, with a tough flexible high-density skin and a softer low-density core, which makes it more durable than other foams, as the bubble structure is not exposed. This foam can be made in different levels of hardness for various applications such as in steering wheels, or squeezy stress-balls. Self-skinning foam is also used for special effects and prosthetics like ‘fat suits’ in the entertainment industry as the rubber skin can be moulded and painted to look and behave like human flesh.

This sample of blonde wax is a mixture of rosin (a brittle, dusty and solid amber-coloured resin derived from pines trees) and beeswax. The rosin, also known as colophony or Greek pitch, gives this wax its tackiness. It is made by heating fresh liquid tree sap (oleo-resin) to remove the volatile liquid terpene compounds. If you scratch off a small amount of this substance and warm it up between your fingers, it smells like a mixture of pine and turpentine. Rosin typically varies in colour from very pale and transparent to dark brown or yellow depending on the age of tree the sap is extracted from and the temperature to which it is heated. Rosin is crucial for creating sound in string instruments as it allows the horsehair bowstrings to grip the metal strings of the instrument and ‘make them speak’. The different colours of rosin are said to produce different tones as a result of their differential stickiness, and as such, there are many different types formulated for different kinds of tone (subtle or aggressive), particular kinds of playing conditions like humidity, or specific instruments (violin verse cello). This particular rosin and beeswax mix is sometimes used instead of pure rosin on bows, as the wax content adds to the ‘stiction’ (static friction) or friction characteristics of the substance, modifying the tone produced by the instrument. This wax and resin mix is also used for hair-removal, as a material for softening, protecting and waterproofing leather in shoemaking, and for coating the fibres of imitation flies used in fly-fishing so that they look more lifelike and animated.

The bamboo belongs to the grass family. It is one of the fastest growing plants in the world- some growing up to 3 feet in a day.  It has a higher compressive strength that wood, brick or concrete and also has a specific tensile strenght that rivals steel.

Whilst it is most popular as a food source for giant pandas and in Asian cusine, bamboo is also a popular construction material: scaffolding, buildings and bridges. These structures can be found in many South East Asian cultures. In addition, bamboo is being explored in making bicycle frames. Due its abundance, it can be easily replaceable when worn out. A challenge with using bamboo is that it cracks longitudinally when dried out as seen in the sample available. To combat the cracking and increase the longevity of bamboo, its surface could be treated using resin or wax.

MycoFoam or mushroom packaging is an alternative to styrofoam. It is made from mycelium and agricultural waste. The mycelium which is are a mass or filaments/ mushroom roots are introduced to argicultural waste to let it grow. Once its reached the optimal condition, the materials are dried to prevent further growth of mushrooms and spores- producing MycoFoam. Since it is only made from agricultural waste, MycoFoam is more environmentally friendly and are less dangerous for animals should this end up in the sea.

Heamotoxylum Campechianum is the scientific name of bloodwood or logwood. Logwood is a species of flowering tree in the legume family, Fabaceae, that is native to Southern Mexico and Central America. Its name, bloodwood is a very apt one; it is used as a natural source of dye which produces varieties of violets which is also dependent on the pH value of the solution used. In accidic environments, the dye takes on a reddish colour and in alkaline environments, it takes on more bluish tones. Logwood dyes is used widely on textiles and papers as well as pH indicators. It is also an important source of haemotoxylin which is used in histology for staining. 

The dyeing process begins with soaking and boiling logwood chips for two hours and up to overnight. The chips are then strained before placing the textile/wool into the water. The intensity of the violet colour or other shades can be obtained by adding alum or iron which changes the pH of the water and thus the resulting colour.

Wood has a tendency of splitting when nailled at the edges due to the arrangement of its grains/fibers. Plywood, made of thin sheets of wood glued together with each sheets' grain at 90° to the adjacent sheet, would less likely split when nailed at the edge. The cross-graining increases the strength of the whole sheet, and also reduces overall shrinkage or expansion. Plywood can be used both inddors and outdoors. Outdoor use plywood would uses a water resistant glue to prevent delamination (the layering). When working with plywood, several factors should be taken into consideration including location, thickness of plywood and flexibility.

This piece of oak wood is named such as it has been buried in a peat bog for hundreds to thousands of years.  The low levels of oxygen has protected the wood from decay. Other peat conditions- the presence of iron salts and other minerals- react with the tannin in the wood giving it its distinct dark brown to black colour. Bog oak is highly valuable due to its rarity.
