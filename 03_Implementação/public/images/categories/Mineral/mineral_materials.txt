Chalk sticks, used as writing and drawing implements by maths teachers and artists alike, were traditionally made out of natural chalk - a soft and porous sedimentary rock composed of calcium carbonate deposits formed over about 90 million years from the compression of the decomposing skeletons of phytoplankton (tiny marine algae), on the ocean floor. Chalk has been used as a pigment in art since the Palaeolithic era, and became particularly popular in the 15th century amongst Early Renaissance artists. A lot of the children's coloured chalks, artists' pastels and 'pavement chalks' we use now are made from softer and less expensive calcareous materials like gypsum (calcium sulphate). However, anxieties over the potential health hazard of the blackboard dust generated by these cheaper materials led to the development of 'dustless' classroom chalks: these chalks primarily use calcium carbonate (natural chalk) as their raw material, and are extruded as a 'rope' of chalk. This process of extruding calcium carbonate makes the chalk particles heavier so they fall straight to the ground, rather than flying around as dust. Impurities in chalk deposits naturally produce chalks of different colours, but pigments - in this case a raw Sienna brown - are added to make colours more vivid. In order to make chalk sticks, the chalk or gypsum is pulverized to a fine powder, mixed with a binder (like clay), water and a pigment to form a putty, then formed into cylinders and baked.

Road salt is put onto roads in the winter to prevent ice from forming, or to deal with it once it has. When salt is added to water it decreases the melting point, so adding salt to ice that has just frozen will melt it. It may not stay melted for long if the temperature continues to drop, or if you do not keep adding salt. However, this is where the other ingredient of road salt comes in. Grit. Grit is added to the salt and this provides a gripper surface to the road, preventing to some extent the development of dangerously smooth slick ice. Concrete road, bridges and tunnels can suffer extreme degradation in countries where road salt is routinely used in the winter. This is because the salt gets into the concrete and starts to corrode the steel reinforcement, the resulting rust expands creating cracks and allowing salt to infiltrate further. It used to be called concrete cancer, but the term is no longer used.

Graphite is the most stable form of carbon in nature. This black mineral is very brittle and can easily be broken by hand. The name derives from the Greek word grapho (to write), as graphite is the material used to make pencils. Graphite occurs naturally in different types of ores; crystalline graphite usually shows hexagonal or angular edges when freshly broken. This is a reflection of the crystalline structure in which the carbon atoms are arranged in honeycomb layers stacked on top of each other. Apart from its use in pencils, graphite is also used for its ability to conduct electric current (i.e. carbon microphones and arc lamps) and thanks to its lamellar structure, it is a solid lubricant, typically used in machines that operate at high temperatures.

This large sphere just about fits in the palm of an adult woman’s hand, looks like a lead cannonball in colour and texture, but pick it up and you will find it is disconcertingly light. That is because it is made from expanded polystyrene foam, coated in a layer of graphite. This type of rigid foam is widely used for packaging where bulk but not weight is required. It is also a good thermal insulator and shock absorber. Polystyrene can also be carved easily, formed in moulds and recycled. Why this ball of polystyrene is coated in graphite, we are not quite sure! Graphite is conductive so perhaps it was designed for some form of scientific instrumentation looking at conductivity. We prefer to imagine this item as a fake shot put, possibly starring in the pivotal scene of a historical drama about the Highland Games. If you have any ideas about what this could be used for, please let us know.

Slate is a grey/blue/green-ish metamorphic rock that is formed from layers of shale, a sedimentary rock that is deposited on the bed of streams and rivers. Over vast periods of time, as the layers of shale dust build up, so does the heat and pressure exerted on these layers, which causes the metamorphic transformation from shale to slate. Slate is found in mountainous regions, explaining its presence in northwest Wales, where mining reached its peak in the 1800s and is still excavated to this day, though on a much smaller scale. Slate contains what is known as a cleavage plane – a brittle layer that separates thin sheets of slate. Tapping along this plane with a hammer and chisel enables the layers to separate, forming a smooth tile typically used for roofing and flooring.

This fine-grained grey piece of rock is the strongest and most durable type of slate ever discovered. It is extracted in northwest Wales, the industry that surrounded it’s mining used to dominate the economic activity of this area until the beginning of the 20th century. It is very resistant to high temperatures and chemicals, and its low absorption rate makes it very resistant to frost damage and breaking – one of the main reasons for its popularity as a roofing material. Its durability is another reason for its use in the building industry. Some famous examples of roofs that have employed this material can be seen in London at St Pancras’ station or at No.10 Downing Street. Welsh slate is also a very popular material in paving, cladding and walling, while high quality slates are also employed for tombstones and blackboards. Due to its stability and chemical inertness, slates are also used in the manufacture of laboratory bench tops and the stability of the material makes it ideal for the flat surface beneath the baize of billiard and snooker tables. Fine slate can also be used as a whetstone to hone knives.

When you break a bone in your body, the bone is only able to repair itself effectively if all of the original material is present and a good contact can be forged between the fragments. This bioactive glass scaffold is designed to help in situations when this conditions are not met. It sits between fragments of bone in place of missing material. However, the glass doesn’t replace the bone fragment permanently, it acts as a bridge for natural bone growth. As the bone grows it consumes the scaffold, eventually leading to a perfectly fused join. The scaffold is porous, so it contains an interconnected network of pores so that cells, blood vessels and new bone can penetrate into the material. Materially, the scaffold has to possess a number of important characteristics. It needs to be biocompatible so the body doesn’t reject it, it needs to be bioactive so it will fuse to existing bone, it needs to withstand the same loads as the surrounding bone, and it must degrade as new bone grows through it.

Diamond is the hardest bulk material found on earth, and is treasured for its aesthetic beauty. These two qualities lead diamond to live a double life: one getting down and dirty as a powerful industrial tool for cutting and grinding, and the other living the high life adorning treasured rings, necklaces and earrings around the world. Diamond is pure carbon. The carbon atoms are arranged in regular crystal lattice, where each atom is strongly bound to four other carbon atoms. This structure is the root of carbon’s strength. Most natural diamonds are formed in the depths of the earth’s mantle nearly 200 kilometres below the surface where pressure and temperature is extremely high. The diamonds are shuttled near to the earth’s surface by deep volcanic eruptions and become embedded in rocks formed from cooling magma. These rocks are then mined by man in order to recover the precious contents. Diamonds can also be made synthetically in laboratories where they can simulate the high temperature and pressure found in the earth’s mantle. Many naturally occurring diamonds contain impurities that cause them to fluoresce under UV light.

This pale green mineral is called adamite and this particular sample comes from Mexico. Pure adamite is colourless, but it usually contains impurities that bestow it with colour. Adamite is commonly yellow due to iron compounds, but this green specimen is given its colour by the presence of copper in the mineral. Adamite is a zinc arsenate hydroxide mineral, and is commonly found in weathered zones above natural zinc deposits. Trace amounts of uranium make this particular sample shine fluorescent green under UV light.

This clear rhombahedral crystal is calcium carbonate, a compound of calcium and carbon. It exists in three different mineral forms known as aragonite, vaterite and calcite. The most stable of the three is calcite, and that is the form of this crystal. Pure calcite is transparent, however small amounts of different impurities can give shades of gray, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet, brown or even black. Calcite can occur naturally as very large crystals, the largest on record measuring 6×6×3 metres, weighing in at 250 tonnes. Calcium carbonate is a fundamental ingredient in many biomineralisation processes, giving to bones, teeth and shells.

This large green crystal is a spinel. Spinel crystals consist of magnesium aluminium oxide and naturally occur in variety of colours, due to trace amounts of other elements in the structure. This particular crystal is a chlorospinel, with its characteristic green appearance arising due to trace amounts of copper and iron. Bright red spinels are the most valuable due to their similarity in appearance to the ruby. In fact, many old rubies have been found to be spinels, including the Black Prince’s Ruby that forms the centrepiece of the Royal Crown of Great Britain. Curiously, despite red spinels being much rarer than real rubies, they are less valuable than rubies.

Flint is a glassy, waxy-looking sedimentary rock, which can be knapped into faceted shapes with very hard and sharp edges. It is one of the hardest naturally occurring materials and has an inner structure is amorphous, similar to that of glass. Shaping flints be striking them with other rocks or tools (flint knapping) is quite a skill as there is no grain to the material and flakes of flint fracture off as a result of the shock waves that are caused by a strike. Some of the ripples of these waves are visible on the surface of flakes that fall away. These flint shards have been flaked from a much larger piece; you can see the rind-like surface of the naturally occurring nodule from which they came. Flint nodules, along with great layers of flint, are found in between ancient layers of soft sedimentary rock like limestone or chalk. They are likely to have developed from the decomposed skeletons of billions of silica-based sea-creatures. Knapped flints were among the first reliable tools made by humans for hunting, butchering and scraping animal hide, as well as a fire-making tool. Flint creates sparks when struck with a harder or equivalent material and if you have ever thrown rocks onto a pebble beach in the dark you may have seen this. It is worth noting that flints should not be used to line a fire pit, as the heat will make them explode into very sharp hot flying fragments. Flint is still used as a tool to this day in eye-surgery as an ultra-thin and sharp knife, for it can be made more sterile than metal and incisions heal better due to fine nature of the blade it makes.

This green rock is the naturally occurring source of all copper. Unlike gold, which can be found in the ground in its elemental state, copper needs to be extracted from its ore – malachite. Extraction is done by a process of smelting where malachite is heated with carbon to extract the oxygen from the copper oxide that is found within the rock. This leaves behind nuggets of metallic copper, which can be melted down and purified to produce copper that is ready for use in applications like electrical wiring. The surface of copper easily oxides, as it re-bonds with the oxygen in our atmosphere, and as a result tarnishes and will eventually turn green again – in effect, returning to a state of malachite.

Marble is formed when limestone is exposed to high temperatures and pressures. These high temperature and pressures results in changes in the microstructure where recrystalization occurs and a denser rock is formed. Marble can come in a variety of colours which is due to the impurities present when transformation occured. Recrystalization of pure limestone would result in an all white marble. The black colour in this marble sphere is believed to be due a presence of a high bitumen content. 

Marble is a valuable stone in many industries for its aesthetics, chemical and optical properties. When polished, marble It is used as tiles, cabinet surfaces as well as carved into decorative items. Its use is documented as far back as 200 BC. Popular structures made of marble include the Parthenon in Greece, the Taj Mahal in India and the door of the Hagis Sophia in Istanbul. When first mined, marble is relatively soft which makes it easy to sculpt and shape. The material gradually hardens as it ages and with some treatment (ie polishing) making it a relatively versatile material to work with. However, marble is particularly susceptible to acidic agents as it is made predominantly of calcium carbonate which is easily dissolved by acid.

Coal is the remains of prehistoric organic matter in what was once swamps and peat bogs. It consists mainly of carbon with varying quantities of hydrogen, sulphur, orxygen and nitrogen. Under favourable conditions, these organic matter was compressed under high pressure and temperature forming this hard black mass we know today. The energy released from burning coal comes from the stored solar energy, millions of years ago. The quality of coal is dependent on the type of vegetation it is made of, the depth, temperature & pressure and its 'age'.
