In the future we may be surrounded by concrete structures, which are able to self-heal cracks in their structure, with special bacteria doing the job for us. Tiny cracks in concrete do not necessarily affect structural integrity in the short term, but they do allow water and other chemicals to seep into the structure, which may cause big problems over time. Self-healing concrete has dormant bacteria and a food source (starch) embedded in the concrete. When a crack appears in the concrete, water seeps in and reactivates the bacteria. After they awaken, the bacteria eat their packed lunch and then conveniently excrete calcite, which heals the crack. The bacteria can survive dormant in the material for 50 years.

This orange plate is part of a cup and saucer set of Fiestaware, from the USA. Uranium oxide was used in the glaze, which makes these pieces radioactive. Fiesta was the first widely mass-marketed solid-colour dinnerware and became extremely popular due to its bright colours, durable construction and stylized art deco designs. After its introduction in 1936 it was a widespread fad in the USA for over 10 years, becoming somewhat of a status symbol. During the Second World War, the US government took control of uranium in the country and confiscated the stocks of all companies which used it. Nowadays, the government advises that these pieces are not used, however they are still very popular collectors’ items.

This tiny white porcelain-like Polo is a ring of aluminium oxide ceramic. However this is not your ordinary, china mug-type ceramic; this material is so hard that once it’s been fired and sintered it has to be cut using diamond tooling. The traditional ceramics that we recognise from our kitchens are objects made of clay and cements that have been hardened by heating at high temperatures, whereas advanced or ‘engineered’ ceramics like this one are made by sintering fine powders of pure chemical compounds formed between metallic (aluminium) and non-metallic (oxygen) elements, such as aluminium oxide, or metalloid (silicon) and non-metallic (carbon) elements, such as silicon carbide. This aluminium oxide or alumina powder is often mixed with an organic binder to help it keep its desired shape before it is fixed. This moulded powder is then heated to a very high temperature in a controlled atmosphere until its individual particles fuse together and form chemical bonds (sintering), shrinking and hardening it into a dense, strong ceramic. The result is a material with extreme strength, wear resistance, corrosion resistance, an ability to withstand high temperatures and biocompatibility. Because aluminium oxide ceramic’s main components are partially the same minerals found in bone structure, it is used for hip replacements, dental crowns and tooth implants.

This rectangular sample of tough white ceramic looks like plastic, but its weight and the glassy chink sound it makes when two pieces are tapped together, give away that it is not. However this is not your ordinary, china-mug-type ceramic. One of the distinctive features of traditional ceramics is that it cannot be worked or shaped once it has been fired, but this material can be machined with ordinary metal cutting tools. The kind of ceramic you would have in your kitchen is obviously very brittle – imagine trying to cut that with an electric saw! This material is a special engineered glass-ceramic, produced in two stages by first casting glass, and then heating that glass with additives that control the way it crystallises. This causes it to have some of the properties of a ceramic, and some of a glass. Although it might seem counter-intuitive, this combination of materials makes the final material much tougher and more shatter-proof than either a standard glass or ceramic, as well as yielding interesting properties like biocompatibility (glass ceramics can be used as scaffolding for tissue engineering). Because glass-ceramics can withstand very high temperatures and are resistant to chemical attack, this material can be used to make very tough parts for tasks that metals and polymers cannot manage.
