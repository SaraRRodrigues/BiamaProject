This treacle-coloured, crystalline object was found by the Institute of Making’s Creative Director Zoe Laughlin at her family farm. Although completely warped and now totally dysfunctional as a result of UV degradation, it is still recognisably a roll of Sellotape. Sellotape is in fact the trademark of the British brand, but it has become the colloquial name for transparent, cellulose-based tape with an adhesive on one side. This generic trademark has even made it into the Oxford English Dictionary.

These rubber bands are made from natural rubber. To make natural rubber, a milky white sap, called latex, is tapped from a rubber tree. An acid, such as formic acid, is added to the latex to make it coagulate, and then it is passed through rollers to remove excess water, and the whole thing is dried. This purified natural rubber is polyisoprene, which is both an elastomer and a thermoplastic. To make the rubber bands, this purified rubber is drawn out into a long tube, which is then cut into slices. Over time, rubber loses its ability to stretch, becoming hard and brittle. This process of perishing occurs because exposure of the rubber to light and air induces chemical changes in the polyisoprene over time.

This brown modelling wax smells a bit like plasticine and is similarly easily softened by the heat from your hands. It’s malleability and low melting point mean that it is particularly useful for lost wax casting, where the artist produces a wax model which is subsequently surrounded by a mould material, usually made of silicone, latex or polyurethane. The wax is then melted in a kiln and the original model destroyed so that molten metal can be poured into its original place to produce the final cast. This wax looks black on initial inspection, but if you pull a little ball off and squash it between your fingers you’ll see that is has the texture and colour of the inside of a raisin.

This dark red, knobbly, bouncy toy ball is made of classic red natural rubber, the kind that is so dearly wished for in A.A. Milne’s poem “King John’s Christmas.” This material is made by refining latex, the milky sap produced by cutting the bark of tropical plants like the Para Rubber Tree, and the Rubber Fig. Latex is also produced by more familiar plants like lettuce and dandelions. While rubber had been used locally for many years, it was first commercially produced in France and England in the late 1700s, named for its ability to ‘rub out’ pencil and graphite marks on paper. It was also known as India Rubber, or China Rubber by the colonialists. Rubber is produced in industrial quantities today in South-East Asian tropical countries, but the latex is still tapped from trees in the traditional way. To make this ball durable and extra bouncy, the rubber is cured by the addition of sulphur, which is called vulcanisation (named after Vulcan, the Roman God of fire). The rubber, a natural polymer, then becomes an elastomer.

These glasses contain lenses which can be self-adjusted by the wearer to their prescription, and were developed as a low-cost and accessible eye care solution for people in developing nations. The lens consists of two membranes, in between which silicon oil can be pumped with the syringes on the side of the frames. As fluid is pumped in or out, the focal length of the lens is changed, meaning the lens can be tuned to the specific requirements of the eye. The syringes can then be removed. The inventor of these glasses was nominated for a 2011 European Invention Award.

Expanded polystyrene receives a lot of negative press, partly due to the adverse environmental effects it is often associated with. No known organism can biodegrade it, and because it is so lightweight and friable, it has historically been an abundant and very visible form of pollution - especially on beaches and riverbanks. From a sensory point of view, it is vilified for its squeak, which, according to Institute of Making's Director of Research, Dr Mark Miodownik, “curdles the brain much like the scratch of fingernails on a blackboard.” And the feeling of biting into it is sensually abhorrent. However, this unloved material is used extensively in construction because it is a great thermal, vibration and acoustic insulator: by dampening sound, it protects against seismic activity and retains heat. Because of its excellent impact-resistance and light weight we rely on it to protect fragile goods (in packaging) and our heads (in bicycle helmets). Sculptors, scenographers and prop-makers rely on it to make lightweight and realistic models. Mock-ups of temples, palaces, and even the iconic shoot-out in the federal building in The Matrix are as convincing as they are thanks to polystyrene.

This composite material is a sandwich of polyester resin, glass fibres and an aramid paper honeycomb. These three materials can be fairly weak in isolation, but combined in this particular structure they are exceptionally strong for their weight. So strong in fact that these kind of reinforced honeycomb sandwich panels have been used in the floor and wing panels of Boeing 747s. The geometry of the honeycomb, which occurs naturally in bones and beehives, gives it very good stiffness and resistance to compression. Because each of the tessellating hexagons is hollow, the honeycomb uses less material for the same function and has heat and sound insulating properties. Because the glass fibre and paper are immersed in a transparent resin, you can see the intermeshing materials, which create an interesting optical effect.

Greek mythology attributes the first man-made honeycomb to the inventor Daedalus, who is said to have made one from gold using the lost wax method more than 3000 years ago. The geometry of the honeycomb, which occurs naturally in bones and beehives, gives it very good stiffness for its weight, and as a result it is often found in aircraft applications. This particular honeycomb is (probably) made from a high-temperature resistant aramid paper. Aramids are a group of very strong and heat-resistant synthetic polymers, including Kevlar, which are used in aerospace and military applications for ballistic body-armour, in bicycle tires, and as an asbestos substitute.

This material is described as ‘live-edged’ because the edges of the material glow under ambient light as if it has its own internal light source. It is also known as a ‘light-gathering’ acrylic because the live edge is a result of the extruded sheet gathering light from all over its surface, which is then refracted internally and emitted wherever it has been cut. In this case, the laser-cut edges glow, but you can also see some glow from a scratched area in the middle of the sample, and if you were to purposefully engrave the surface of this material, it would also glow. The polymer contains fluorescent dyes to accentuate this effect, so the light emitted gets stronger under UV light and weaker if you place it flat on the table and slowly cover the surface with your hand.

Produced in collaboration between architects Dissing+Weitling and Lindberg, a Danish eyewear manufacturer, these super-elastic ‘Air Titanium Rim’ glasses are made without the use of screws, rivets or soldering. The titanium wire that makes up the frame is incredibly thin, lightweight and strong, and is bent and twisted into the hinges, the bridge and the ear clips so that the optician fitting these glasses can tailor them to each client. Titanium is an attractive material for glasses being light and strong – it is also capable of being alloyed to display super-elasticity. The nose pads and silicone ear clips are made from medical silicone, which is a hypoallergenic material just like titanium. These materials are therefore well-suited to being used in this sort of prosthetic devices that come in close contact with the human body in order to improve its performance.

This unassuming looking material is a surprisingly high-performance fabric. Gore-Tex is the trade name for this porous polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) fabric membrane whose chemical inertia and biocompatibility mean that it is used to mimic the stomach wall in hernia operations and to replace veins in vascular grafts – in aortic bypasses, for example. However Gore-Tex is probably most well-known for its ability to protect us from the elements in breathable rainwear. By rapidly stretching PTFE under the right conditions you can create a very strong, durable, and waterproof microporous material that interacts in an interesting way with water in its various states. The surface of the PTFE membrane is pitted with over 9 billion microscopic pores per square inch, and these pores are approximately 20,000 times smaller than a drop of water, but 700 times bigger than a molecule of moisture vapour. Water droplets can’t penetrate Gore-Tex but moisture vapour – sweat, for example – can easily escape. These qualities of chemical inertia, biocompatibility and microporosity also make this material useful as a bandage. This sample came from a cycle shop where it was sold as a gauze to dress cycling injuries: while protecting the wound from rain, dirt and contaminating substances, it still allows it to ‘breathe.'

This polyurethane rubber is a softer and stretchier alternative to silicone rubber. However, whilst silicones are inert, urethane rubbers tend to discolour as a result of exposure to UV light and moisture - this sample used to be blue. Silicone rubbers are generally less toxic than urethane rubbers, but the Evergreen range of urethane rubbers (now discontinued) was so-called because it used no suspected carcinogens or substances harmful to human health (mercury, isocyanate, etc) in its formulation. Regardless of the end-product or even type of polyurethane you are using, the way in which you use polyurethane resins is always the same: the raw materials come in two parts, a liquid isocyanate (a very reactive chemical derived from petroleum) and a polyol (a long-chain alcohol), which are mixed to a specified ratio to create a reacting liquid, which is then poured into a mould or onto a surface and left until it cures to form a solid object. This relatively low-tech process makes it a useful material for tinkering and making prototypes.

Metallic threads have been around for thousands of years, used in the clothes of kings and other people of status, in Persian carpets and in Indian saris. These metallic threads would largely have been gold and silver, hammered into extremely thin sheets, cut into ribbons and worked into fabrics. Historically, metallic threads would have been constructed by wrapping a metal strip around a fibre core (usually cotton or silk), often revealing the colour of the fibre core with decorative effects. Most contemporary metallic fibres are manufactured by one of two basic processes: lamination or metallization. Lamination produces a plastic-coated metal, whereby a layer of aluminium is sealed between two layers of acetate or polyester film, and these fibres are then cut into tiny strips for yarns. The metallization process produces a metal-coated plastic by heating the metal until it vaporises and is deposited at high pressure on a polyester film, which is likewise cut into tiny fibres. It is likely that this sample is metallised, since this second process is said to produce fibres that are thinner, more flexible, and more comfortable - like this silky, sleek sample. Alternatively, less common processes for the production of metal fibres include shaving them from wire (as in the case of steel wool), ‘bundle drawing’ them from larger diameter wire, casting them from molten metal, or growing them around a seed (often carbon). Metallic fibres are often used for decorative purposes, for example in lamé and brocade, but because of their mechanical properties they also have a number of technical applications. Aluminium is generally renowned for being extremely lightweight, whilst also very strong. It also has antistatic properties, does not tarnish and reflects radiant heat and electromagnetic radiation, so is perfect for use in protective clothing for demanding environments like fire proximity suits.

This yellow propelling pencil has been made out of a polymer that is commonly called live edge Perspex and contains yellow fluorescent dyes. The intensity of light given off by the polymer is greater at the edges, for the light is gathered along the length of the material and emitted at the ends where the surface area is reduced and the fluorescent effect focused. Whilst the mechanics of the pencil propels graphite to the tip, the material it is made from propels light in the same direction.

Most famously, this clear transparent resin was used by Rachel Whiteread to create Untitled Plinth, her inverted 'mirror-image' cast of the Fourth Plinth in Trafalgar Square. Ten tonnes of this material were poured in one continuous casting process to create the largest resin object in the world. The polymer has an unusual watery transparency, hence the name 'Crystal Clear®'. For this reason it has been used in prop-making to simulate ice cubes and eyeballs. Regardless of the end-product or even type of polyurethane you are using, the way in which you use polyurethane resins is always the same: the raw materials come in two parts, a liquid isocyanate (a very reactive chemical derived from petroleum) and a polyol (a long-chain alcohol), which are mixed to a specified ratio to create a reacting liquid, which is then poured into a mould or onto a surface and left until it cures to form a solid object. The mechanical properties of polyurethane resins are not affected greatly by UV light, but they can discolour over time when exposed to sunlight. This material contains chemical stabilizers that make it UV-resistant and non-brittle, making it very suitable for open-air artefacts.

Being highly impressionable, even the finest detail in the mould will show in the finished product.

This sample of artificial turf is made from nylon or polypropylene fibres that are dyed green to take on the appearance of grass, and a backing that is probably made from polyester tyre cord covered in a layer of latex. It is made in a similar way to carpet: a yarn is made that is then inserted into the backing with a needle in a process called ‘tufting’ and then fixed with the latex. Astroturf is so-called because it came to prominence in 1966 when it was used in the Astrodome, the indoor stadium of baseball team, the Houston Astros. It was installed to replace the real turf that had been starved of sunlight when the acrylic roof panels were painted white to cut down glare that affected players. Artificial turf has the benefit of being much easier and cheaper to maintain than real grass, but has its own drawbacks, one of which is the friction burns caused through sliding on astroturf. The use of polyethylene yarns in the most recent turfs has is an attempt to eliminate this problem.

Artificial snow is made of a polyacrylate polymer, which is shredded to produce flakes of a similar size and colour to real snow. These polymers can absorb water and recreate the feeling of the snow. Wet polyacrylate feels cool to the touch because it’s composed mainly by water; it can also be cooled or frozen to give a more realistic effect. Fake snow is safe and non-toxic and can be used for decorations, window dressing and also for stage performances, usually in combination with fans, to give a controlled snowfall.

Vulcanised rubber is the stuff of car tyres, industrial valves and traditional wellington boots. It is tough, elastic, waterproof, resistant to solvents and impervious to moderate heat and cold. However, these properties do not come naturally. ‘Natural’, or uncured latex rubber is the sap from various types of rubber tree. In this state the rubber is very elastic, but will not last. Over time it will dry out, crack and crumble as it decomposes. The process of vulcanisation was discovered by Charles Goodyear (oddly, no relation to Goodyear tyre manufacturers) and was arguably one of the most important industrial discoveries of the age. Liquid rubber has sulphur added to it, then through a combination of heat and pressure, the inner structure of the rubber changes, making it far stronger and more durable. Named ‘vulcanization’ after the Roman god of fire, this heat process allows the long chains of molecules in the material to bond together, becoming more like a 3D fishing net, geometrically spaced, strong, resilient and elastic in any direction. This black rubber cube has some other ingredients to make it even tougher and abrasion-resistant. Carbon black is used as a pigment and reinforcement, and is made by burning old tyres.

This small translucent orange pebble is amber, a material that has long been treasured for its beauty. It is commonly used in jewellery, and was used in some traditional medicines in Ancient Greece through to the Middle Ages. Amber is produced through the fossilisation of tree resin over many millions of years: the oldest known amber dates back 320 million years. Tree resin contains mostly waste products of the plants physiological processes and its excretion from the tree results in various protective benefits, such as trapping damaging insects. The resin contains a variety of organic molecules that undergo various chemical processes during the fossilisation process, leading to the solid amber. It is common to find insects and animal fragments inside the amber, preserving them perfectly over the millions of years since their entrapment. A small amount of debris can be seen in this small amber sample. Such trapped specimens have contributed to biological and evolutionary research. For example, in September 2011 scientists from Canada published work about their discovery of fossilised bird and dinosaur feathers found inside amber samples. This work had profound implications on our ideas of the evolution of the feather, suggesting feathered dinosaurs may have been much more common than was originally imagined. One way of telling if a piece of amber is genuine is to look at it under a ultraviolet light as real amber fluoresces a ghostly green under UV, but fake amber would not.

Whilst early balloons were made using dried animal bladders, modern balloons are made from latex rubber. In order to make this balloon, a balloon shaped form was dipped into a mixture of latex and orange pigment. The now coated form is then cured in an oven where the latex rubber sets and is then peeled from the form. Latex is also completely biodegradable and a balloon begins to biodegrade the moment you inflate it and stretch the rubber. The process of biodegradation is further expedited by exposure to sunlight. Given the right conditions, latex can biodegrade at about the same rate as a leaf of a tree – that is, around six months.

It looks like the manufacturers of this soft coral-pink foam sphere have made a mould of a golf ball, and cast it in a self-skinning polyurethane foam – perhaps as part of a kid’s toy golf set. This material comes in two parts – a liquid and a catalyst, which, when mixed and poured into a mould, will expand up to six times its original size. As it cures, or ‘goes off’, a tough outer flexible skin forms, which picks up the detail in the mould and creates a visible seam line, which needs to be trimmed off. It can be used in open or closed moulds, as the skin starts forming as the material has finished expanding, not when it reaches a surface, or is exposed to air. It’s an example of an open cell, or reticulated foam, with a tough flexible high-density skin and a softer low-density core, which makes it more durable than other foams, as the bubble structure is not exposed. This foam can be made in different levels of hardness for various applications such as in steering wheels, or squeezy stress-balls. Self-skinning foam is also used for special effects and prosthetics like ‘fat suits’ in the entertainment industry as the rubber skin can be moulded and painted to look and behave like human flesh.

This unfortunate scorpion is entombed in a bubble of transparent plastic with a pearlised blue base, and is being used for weighing down paperwork, or as a slightly alarming ornament. It is stuck to a disc of synthetic felt to protect your desk. The plastic is a two-part synthetic liquid casting resin – usually acrylic or polyurethane. In its liquid state it’s a monomer, which is mixed with its chemical curing agent or catalyst, and poured into a mould containing the scorpion. As the resin hardens, it ‘polymerises’ into a polymer. The chemical exothermic reaction causes the plastic to heat up as it cures, making most casting resins unsuitable for waxy or other low melting objects. Just before the clear resin is hard, the maker would pour in another thin layer containing blue pigment and some sort of pearly powder, to give the paperweight that sea-bed effect. The mould used for the bubble shape was probably made from silicone rubber, which allows the object to emerge clear and shiny, with no need for polishing. Resin is not a pleasant substance to work with, as it gives off irritating chemical fumes which are very smelly. Earlier types of resin tended to go yellow, brittle or cloudy with age and exposure to the UV rays in daylight, ruining many a museum display, but more modern formulations will stay clear and hard indefinitely.
