This composite material is a sandwich of polyester resin, glass fibres and an aramid paper honeycomb. These three materials can be fairly weak in isolation, but combined in this particular structure they are exceptionally strong for their weight. So strong in fact that these kind of reinforced honeycomb sandwich panels have been used in the floor and wing panels of Boeing 747s. The geometry of the honeycomb, which occurs naturally in bones and beehives, gives it very good stiffness and resistance to compression. Because each of the tessellating hexagons is hollow, the honeycomb uses less material for the same function and has heat and sound insulating properties. Because the glass fibre and paper are immersed in a transparent resin, you can see the intermeshing materials, which create an interesting optical effect.

Produced in collaboration between architects Dissing+Weitling and Lindberg, a Danish eyewear manufacturer, these super-elastic ‘Air Titanium Rim’ glasses are made without the use of screws, rivets or soldering. The titanium wire that makes up the frame is incredibly thin, lightweight and strong, and is bent and twisted into the hinges, the bridge and the ear clips so that the optician fitting these glasses can tailor them to each client. Titanium is an attractive material for glasses being light and strong – it is also capable of being alloyed to display super-elasticity. The nose pads and silicone ear clips are made from medical silicone, which is a hypoallergenic material just like titanium. These materials are therefore well-suited to being used in this sort of prosthetic devices that come in close contact with the human body in order to improve its performance.

Historically mercury was used to create the reflective surface of mirrors but, misleadingly, mercury glass does not actually contain mercury. It is debated whether the element was ever used to make tableware or decorative vases like this one, but modern mercury glass is unquestionably silvered using a much less toxic solution of silver nitrate. Because this vase has been smashed, you can see how it was made. The silver nitrate coating that gives the objects its mercury-like appearance is poured into the inner chamber of this double-layered glass vessel through a hole in the bottom of the vase, and allowed to dry. The useable internal cavity of this vase is actually very small, as most of the internal space of the object is meant to be closed off from the outside world so the silver doesn’t tarnish. You can see the yellowing and browning of the internal coating where this vase has been exposed to the air.

Clear and transparent in appearance, the glass tuning fork is cool to the touch and has a different shape to the metal, wood and polymer forks due to the method of its manufacture. To make a glass tuning fork with a square cross section, identical to the metal ones, would require a water jet cutter. We did not have access to this technology but instead worked with a glass blower to make this fork from glass rods using lampworking techniques. Two tuning forks were made like this – one to match the pitch of a 440Hz (the note of A) concert pitch tuning fork and the other to match the dimensions of a steel tuning fork that we found with a cylindrical cross section. On playing this tuning fork a clear, bright and high tone, the highest note of all our forks, can be heard, and the note sustains for a reasonable period of time. But be careful! The fragile nature of glass mean that it can easily shatter upon playing, especially if care is note taken when striking to produce a note.

Optical fibres carry telecommunication signals in the form of pulses of light that we rely on for phone and internet. Millions of miles of fibres have been laid across the seabed, enabling fast global telphony and the internet access. They’re composed of a solid glass core, which traps and reflects light along it so that the light follows the curve of the optical fibre. Layers of external cladding are often additionally applied to protect the fibre from damage. Because optical fibres can be used to trap light at one end and then emit it at the other, then another application is in key-hole surgery, which sees the use of optical fibres being inserted into the body to allow surgeons to clearly see what’s going on inside.

These little peppercorn sized transparent glass spheres are made from Soda-Lime glass, familiar to us as the glass used for drinking vessels, bottles and windows. It is reusable and recyclable. In science, glass has a much broader definition than this transparent substance, referring to any solid that has a non-crystalline, or amorphous internal structure. It is a myth that glass is always liquid/is always flowing; it only starts to become a liquid when heated at 550°C and is fully liquid at around 1000°C. Glass spheres are perhaps most familiar to us a marbles, but smaller, industrially produced glass spheres like this are known as Ballotini, from the Italian for small balls. Their main applications include reflective filler for road-marking paint, shot blasting, and metal polishing. However, they can be engineered into perfectly regular spheres, and can be used as spacers in adhesives, to ensure a perfectly uniform thickness of bond, or special bearings for oil drilling mechanics.
